## ðŸ“‹ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure GitHub OAuth

1. **Go to GitHub Developer Settings**:
   - Navigate to [https://github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - Click on "OAuth Apps" in the sidebar
   - Click "New OAuth App"

2. **Fill in the Application Details**:
   - **Application name**: `CodaiPro` (or your preferred name)

     - Get this from your Appwrite Console (see Step 3)
     - Format: `https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/account/sessions/oauth2/callback/github/[PROJECT_ID]`

3. **Register the Application**:
   - Click "Register application"
   - You'll see your **Client ID** displayed
   - Click "Generate a new client secret" to get your **Client Secret**
   - **Important**: Copy both values immediately - the secret won't be shown again!

   - Find **GitHub** in the list
   - Toggle it to enable
   - Enter your **Client ID** (App ID)
   - Enter your **Client Secret**
   - Click **Update**

### Step 2: Configure Google OAuth

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**:
   - Navigate to [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Select your project or create a new one

2. **Enable Google+ API** (if not already enabled):
   - Go to **APIs & Services** â†’ **Library**
   - Search for "Google+ API"
   - Click and enable it

3. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen**:
   - Go to **APIs & Services** â†’ **OAuth consent screen**
   - Choose **External** (unless you have a Google Workspace)
   - Fill in the required information:
     - App name: `CodaiPro`
     - User support email: Your email
     - Developer contact: Your email
   - Add scopes (optional for basic auth):
     - `./auth/userinfo.email`
     - `./auth/userinfo.profile`
   - Add test users if in development mode
   - Click **Save and Continue**

4. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**:
   - Go to **APIs & Services** â†’ **Credentials**
   - Click **Create Credentials** â†’ **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**
   - Choose **Web application**
   - Name: `CodaiPro Web Client`
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins**:
     - `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
     - `https://yourdomain.com` (for production)
   - **Authorized redirect URIs**:
     - Get this from Appwrite Console
     - Format: `https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/account/sessions/oauth2/callback/google/[PROJECT_ID]`
   - Click **Create**
   - Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

5. **Configure in Appwrite Console**:
   - Go to [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io)
   - Select your project
   - Navigate to **Auth** â†’ **Settings** â†’ **OAuth2 Providers**
   - Find **Google** in the list
   - Toggle it to enable
   - Enter your **Client ID** (App ID)
   - Enter your **Client Secret**
   - Click **Update**

### Step 3: Get Appwrite Callback URLs

To find your exact OAuth callback URLs in Appwrite:

1. Go to [Appwrite Console](https://cloud.appwrite.io)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Auth** â†’ **Settings** â†’ **OAuth2 Providers**
4. Click on **GitHub** or **Google**
5. The callback URL will be displayed at the top
6. Copy this URL and use it in your OAuth app configuration

The URL format is:
```
https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1/account/sessions/oauth2/callback/{provider}/{projectId}
```

### Step 4: Update Success/Failure URLs (Optional)

If you want to customize where users land after OAuth:

1. In your code, the URLs are set in `hooks/useAuth.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const successUrl = `${window.location.origin}/dashboard`;
   const failureUrl = `${window.location.origin}/login`;
   ```

2. You can modify these to any route in your application.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test in Development:

1. Make sure your `.env.local` has the Appwrite credentials:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   ```

2. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login` or `http://localhost:3000/register`

4. Click the **GitHub** or **Google** button

5. You should be redirected to the OAuth provider

6. After authorizing, you'll be redirected back and logged in

### Test Flow:

âœ… Click OAuth button â†’ Redirected to provider  
âœ… Sign in with provider â†’ Grant permissions  
âœ… Redirected back to your app â†’ User logged in  
âœ… Check dashboard access â†’ User data loaded  

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### "Invalid OAuth callback URL" error:
- Verify the callback URL in your OAuth app matches exactly what Appwrite shows
- Make sure there are no trailing slashes or extra characters
- Check that the project ID is correct

### "redirect_uri_mismatch" error (Google):
- The redirect URI must be added to **both**:
  - Authorized JavaScript origins
  - Authorized redirect URIs
- URLs must match exactly (including http/https)

### OAuth buttons not working:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Appwrite credentials in `.env.local`
- Make sure OAuth is enabled in Appwrite Console
- Check that Client ID and Secret are correctly entered

### User not redirected after OAuth:
- Check the success/failure URLs are correct
- Verify the `/oauth-callback` route exists
- Check browser console and network tab for errors

### Session not persisting:
- Make sure cookies are enabled
- Check that your domain allows third-party cookies
- Verify Appwrite endpoint is accessible

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit OAuth secrets**:
   - Keep Client Secrets in Appwrite Console only
   - Don't store them in your code or `.env` files committed to Git

2. **Use environment variables**:
   - Store Appwrite credentials in `.env.local` (gitignored)
   - Use different credentials for development and production

3. **Validate redirect URLs**:
   - Only add trusted domains to OAuth apps
   - Use HTTPS in production

4. **Regular security reviews**:
   - Rotate OAuth secrets periodically
   - Monitor OAuth app access logs
   - Review authorized applications

- [GitHub OAuth Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps)
- [Google OAuth Documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)

## ðŸŽ‰ You're All Set!

Your OAuth authentication is now configured! Users can sign in with their GitHub or Google accounts, making registration faster and more secure.

### What Users Will See:

1. On login/register page, they'll see enabled GitHub and Google buttons
2. Clicking a button opens the provider's authorization page
3. After authorizing, they're redirected back to your dashboard
4. Their account is automatically created (if new) or logged in (if existing)

### Next Steps:

- Test both GitHub and Google OAuth flows
- Add more OAuth providers if needed (Appwrite supports 30+ providers)
- Customize the user profile page to show OAuth provider info
- Set up email verification for email/password users
- Add two-factor authentication for enhanced security
