### 1. Install Dependencies (if not already done)

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Appwrite Cloud

1. **Create Appwrite Account**
   - Go to https://cloud.appwrite.io
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Create a new project named "CodaiPro"

2. **Configure Authentication**
   - In your Appwrite console, go to "Auth"
   - Enable "Email/Password" authentication
   - Add `http://localhost:3000` to allowed platforms
   - For production, add your domain (e.g., `https://codai.pro`)

3. **Create Database**
   - Go to "Databases" → Create Database
   - Name it "codai-main"
   - Create these collections:
     - `users` - User profiles
     - `downloads` - Download tracking
     - `analytics` - Usage analytics
     - `feedback` - User feedback

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` with your Appwrite credentials:
