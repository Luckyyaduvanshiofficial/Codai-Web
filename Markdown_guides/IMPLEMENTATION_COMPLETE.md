   - Free while enrolled = Time-limited offer

2. **Social Proof**
   - "10,000+ students" = Popularity
   - University testimonials = Trust
   - GitHub verification = Legitimacy

3. **Easy Entry**
   - No credit card = Lower barrier
   - GitHub signup = One-click verification
   - Instant access = Immediate gratification

4. **Growth Loop**
   - Student uses → Tells classmates → More signups
   - GitHub activity → Social proof
   - University adoption → Mass signups
